 GitHub API Assignment (HW4c)

[![CircleCI](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/img/circleci/JgyDVuYwFUxpx3L4qNCoR6/MzmXwHnPbxoCUJAnVVDTQ9/tree/HW04c_Mocking.svg?style=svg)](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/redirect/circleci/JgyDVuYwFUxpx3L4qNCoR6/MzmXwHnPbxoCUJAnVVDTQ9/tree/HW04c_Mocking)

With this code I realized an advantage of mocks that I had not actually considered, that I could trim down the amount of time testing takes considerably by not needing an external source to send information.  In hindsight this is obvious and intuitive, but seeing the time taken go from nearly 10 seconds to a fraction of a second made it very clear to me.  There wasn't anything asked for in the README for this branch aside from the badge so I will leave it there.
