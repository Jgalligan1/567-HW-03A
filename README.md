 GitHub API Assignment (HW4a)

When I was designing the code I decided that it was most important to include tests for both valid and invalid inputs.  I made sure to in github_api.py include that it should raise an exception if it failed to fetch a username because I wanted it to be clear when it failed to fetch anything because there was no response vs no data.  I had never done something like this coding assignment so I wanted to be sure, and it would be helpful for testing later to determine if it raised the exception when applicable.  Then when designing the specific tests I decided the best things to test would be if it could get a user, if it responded appropriately to trying to fetch a non-existent user, and if it could find correct data from a user which I knew the data of (myself.).  One of my biggest issues was just trying to get Travis-CI to work, something which took me hours of troubleshooting only to ultimately give up and swap to Circle-CI.  I didn't know how the testing software was meant to work so I wasn't sure if I needed to create the code in a certain way in order to make it work, although ultimately I realized that my code was not the problem.  Because the error was external to my code I really struggled to actually improve the testing of my code, because I had relatively little ability to test what the actual problem was since it was with external software.  The other challenge was determining what the proper amount of tests was.  There wasn't a clear amount of tests which had to happen, so I just decided to do three arbitrarily, but any amount could have been reasonable.  I certainly could have done many more tests, and if this was being deployed as a product or it didn't work as immediately as it did its posisble I would regret making so few test cases.
